# Shopify Internship Challenge

This is my code for the Shopify Winter 2020 Internship interview.

This code requires the following prerequisites to build:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ShehryarX/shopify-challenge` will copy the code here to your machine
2. `cd src/` will go into the directory where the code is stored
3. `npm i` will install all required dependencies
4. `npm start` will start the server locally!

This will begin an instance of the server on `http://localhost:5000/` by default. You can test the endpoint using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).

To access documentation, perform steps 1 through 4 and visit `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`.
