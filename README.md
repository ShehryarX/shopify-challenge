# Shopify Internship Challenge

This is my code for the Shopify Winter 2020 Internship interview.

This code requires the following prerequisites to build:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ShehryarX/shopify-challenge`
2. `cd server`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`

This will begin an instance of the server on `http://localhost:5000/` To run the tests, you can run `npm run test`.

To access documentation, perform steps 1 through 4 and visit `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`.
